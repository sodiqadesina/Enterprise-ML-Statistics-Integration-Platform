# Weka ML Classifiers 



## What's about?

Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) is a suite of machine learning software written in Java, developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It is free software licensed under the GNU General Public License. It can be used to develop ML components. 

This project presents examples of using Weka's machine learning/data mining classifier APIs in Java programs.  

1. ec.weka.data folder contains test programs for weka's arff data handling APIs. Weka uses the arff data format to store data. 

2. ec.weka.cls contains programming examples using weka's classifiers APIs,  including linear regression, native bayes, J48 (C4.5) and ANN. 

The linear regression test example uses the same house data as in lab0 ec-regression, but in arff format. 

3. ec.ml.tae contains examples of using Weka's classifiers (KNN, NB, and SVM) for teaching assistance evaluation data. Check Car_ReadMe.md for more details.

4. ec.ml.car contains examples of using Weka's classifiers (KNN, NB, and SVM) for teaching assistance evaluation data.  Check TA_ReadMe.md for more details.
